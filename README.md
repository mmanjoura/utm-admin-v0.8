# utm-admin-v0.8
=====================
The application will be using webpack boilerplate with following features:

* hot reloading React components;
* error handling inside component 
* error handling for syntax errors 


git clone https://github.com/mmanjoura/utm-api.git
cd utm-api
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000

Although the application will run, you will not see any data on the dashboard. The application is depenent on a feed from the UTM-API service, which in turn access a RabitMQ server that is private.
However you can still learn a bit or two on how the internet of things application are built.
The application is an implementation of what we know now as the internet of thing. In our case we are using C27 development board made by u-Blox.
The dev board will usually be repporting the state of a real world entity. That could be the position of a vehicule, the temperature of a device ...anything that could be measured elecronically using some sort of sensors.

The application is using what will be or already the best tools for desinging next generation web apps. 

* Golang
* React
* Redux
